# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Definition of done

Before declaring any Go change complete:

1. `make fmt` — formats with `gofmt` + `goimports`.
2. `golangci-lint run` — must exit 0. Run on just the touched package for speed (e.g. `golangci-lint run ./internal/app/...`).
3. No `.go` file may exceed **500 lines**. `make lint` enforces this; if you hit it, split by concern into sibling files in the same package rather than inflating a single file.
4. Tests pass for the touched package.
5. **At the end of development**, run `make lint` — it mirrors CI by running `go test -race -v ./...` followed by golangci-lint and the 500-line check. The race detector catches issues plain `go test` misses (e.g. value-receiver methods like `Workspace.Root()` copy the whole struct, so a goroutine calling them races with any concurrent field write). `make test-race` is the same race run without lint, handy for reproducing a CI failure in isolation.

Don't batch these up for a later cleanup pass — fix as you go.

## Common commands

```bash
make build            # builds `medusa` and `medusa-approve-compound`
make run              # build + run the TUI
make dev              # hot-reload via air
make test             # go test -v ./...
make test-race        # go test -race -v ./... (mirrors CI; slower)
make lint             # full gate: test-race + golangci-lint + 500-line check
make fmt              # gofmt + goimports
make bench            # compositor render benchmarks
```

Run a single test:
```bash
go test ./internal/app -run TestCopyIgnoredFiles -v
```

Sandbox integration tests are gated behind a build tag and require an unsandboxed host (nested `sandbox-exec` fails):
```bash
make test-sandbox-mode
```

Headless render/perf harness (no human, no terminal):
```bash
go run ./cmd/medusa-harness -mode monitor -frames 5 -warmup 1
go run ./cmd/medusa-harness -mode center  -frames 5 -warmup 1
go run ./cmd/medusa-harness -mode sidebar -frames 5 -warmup 1
```

`release-check` runs tests + all three harness modes — use it to validate UI-adjacent changes without a real terminal.

## Architecture

Medusa is a Bubble Tea v2 TUI that orchestrates multiple Claude Code (or other agent) sessions, each pinned to its own git worktree and its own tmux session.

### The root model: `internal/app`

`app.App` is the single `tea.Model`. Every `tea.Msg` flows through `App.Update` → `App.update` in `internal/app/app_input.go`. Routing order matters:

1. **Dialog results** (`common.DialogResult`) are handled first by `handleDialogResult`.
2. **Help overlay** consumes input if visible.
3. **`routeOverlayInput`** (`app_input_overlays.go`) runs the chain of modal overlays (dialog, file picker, settings, theme, sound, permissions, sandbox rules editor, profile manager). If any is visible, it consumes the message and the main switch is skipped.
4. **Main `switch msg.(type)`** handles window-size, mouse, keypress, and a small set of high-frequency messages.
5. **`default`** dispatches to `routePTYMsg` (tab / PTY / tmux tick messages) then `routeSystemMsg` (permissions, updates, action-bar, file watcher), and finally forwards unknown messages to `center.Update`.

When adding a new message handler, decide first which of these layers owns it — handlers in the wrong layer can be shadowed by an overlay or fire before the active workspace is set.

### Center pane: per-tab PTY + virtual terminal

`internal/ui/center.Model` owns the workspace tab bar and all running agents. Each `Tab` holds:

- a tmux session name (session-per-tab is what survives restarts),
- an `internal/pty.Terminal` + `internal/vterm.VTerm` pair (the PTY reader goroutine writes raw bytes; VTerm renders them),
- a pending-output buffer with debounced flushes (`model_input_pty.go`: `updatePTYOutput` → `updatePTYFlush`).

PTY readers run as long-lived goroutines. They capture the workspace ID at start; when a workspace is renamed, `MigrateWorkspaceTabs` populates `wsIDRedirects` so stale messages resolve to the new ID instead of killing the readers.

Workspace rename: do NOT restart PTY readers — the redirect map handles routing and restarting races with the blocked read goroutine.

### Workspace / worktree model: `internal/data`

A `Workspace` can span multiple repos (each with its own worktree) but shares a single branch. `Workspace.Root()` is the primary worktree root; `AllRoots()` / `PrimaryWorktreeRoot()` account for multi-repo layouts. Registry at `~/.medusa/workspaces.json` is the source of truth; `data.Registry` and `data.WorkspaceStore` are both guarded by `sync.Mutex` (saveLocked/deleteLocked pattern). Orphan handling has two flavors: `OrphanMetadata` (registry knows about a dir that's gone) and `OrphanDirectory` (dir on disk with no registry entry).

### Messages: `internal/messages`

Pure type declarations; no package may import app/ui code. Split into several files by concern (`messages_permissions.go`, `messages_actionbar.go`, `messages_sidebar.go`). When adding a message, check whether a concern-scoped file already exists before adding to `messages.go`.

### Entry points

- `cmd/medusa` — the TUI binary.
- `cmd/medusa-approve-compound` — standalone helper invoked as a Claude Code hook for permission prompts.
- `cmd/medusa-harness` — headless render driver used by `make release-check` and benchmarks.

### Configuration

Per-repo workspace config lives at `.medusa/workspaces.json` (setup-workspace, run, archive). Environment variables passed to those commands include `$ROOT_WORKSPACE_PATH` plus an auto-allocated free port (`internal/process/env.go`).

## Commits & releases

Conventional-commit-lite — the `.goreleaser.yml` changelog filter depends on the prefix. See `.claude/skills/medusa-commits-and-releases/SKILL.md` for the full table and the release walkthrough.

Short version: `feat:` / `fix:` / `refactor:` / `perf:` surface in release notes; `docs:` / `test:` / `ci:` / `chore:` don't.
